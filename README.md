# Optical-Charecter-Recognition
This has the code for various OCR Modules in Python

Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast)

We have used Pytesseract and EasyOCR to read text from saved files and then read the text aloud
